MT108 License

"Freely you have received; freely give." Jesus (Matthew 10. 8)

This license is a biblical one; it is based on the evangelical principle
that Jesus highlights simply and clearly with these words (see verse above).

It's by the Lord's grace that we are saved, because Jesus paid the price for.
He did it all at the cross; as he was dying he said:

"It is finished!" (John 19. 30)

If the most important thing (the salvation of our soul) is received by grace,
freely, what else can we do than giving freely, as we have received?!

"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith,
and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God."
Ephesians 2. 8

"Amen amen I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes Him who sent me,
has eternal life,
and doesn't come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life."
Jesus (John 5. 24)

Jesus is the one and only one way to go to the Father:

"I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father, except through me."
Jesus (John 14. 6)

Receive the Son of God, Jesus the Messiah (Christ), today! Live by
faith in Him, and walk by His Holy Spirit (Galatians 5. 16).

Jesus is ALIVE, he has risen from the dead; and he's coming soon!

"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!
And let him who hears say, Come!
And let him who thirsts come.
Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.
...

He that testifies these things says: Yes, I come quickly.

Amen, come Lord Jesus!

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with all the saints."
Revelation 22. 17 and 20, 21
